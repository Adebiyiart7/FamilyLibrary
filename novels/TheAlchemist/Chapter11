Chapter 11

After spending several months at the oasis, the boy realized that it was time for him to continue his journey. He knew that he was getting closer to the pyramids, and he was eager to meet the alchemist who could help him.

The woman who had welcomed him to the oasis gave him a gift of a small, red stone, and she told him that it would protect him on his journey. She also gave him a bag of gold, which would be enough to buy him food and shelter for several months.

The boy thanked her for her kindness and set out into the desert. He walked for several days, following the stars and the omens that he had learned to read, and he faced many challenges along the way.

He encountered sandstorms and scorpions, and he had to cross treacherous mountain passes and raging rivers. But he never lost faith in his Personal Legend, and he knew that he was getting closer to his treasure.

One night, as he was resting by a campfire, he saw a shooting star in the sky. He remembered the words of the alchemist, who had told him that when a person really desires something, the whole universe conspires to help that person realize their dream.

The boy knew that this was a sign that he was on the right path, and he felt a renewed sense of determination. He continued on his journey, crossing the vast desert until he finally reached the outskirts of the city where the alchemist lived.

As he approached the city, the boy felt a sense of excitement and anticipation. He knew that he was about to meet the man who could help him fulfill his Personal Legend. He walked through the bustling streets, searching for the alchemist's house.

And finally, after many hours of searching, he found the house of the alchemist. He knocked on the door, and a servant opened it. The boy asked to see the alchemist, and the servant told him to wait.

The boy waited anxiously, hoping that the alchemist would see him. He knew that his journey was not over yet, and that there were still many challenges that lay ahead. But he was ready to face them, and he was determined to realize his dream.
