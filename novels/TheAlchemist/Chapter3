Chapter 3

The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for almost a month, and he was happy with the work. The merchant was a good man, and he seemed to trust the boy. But the boy's heart was heavy, and he knew that it was because he was so close to his dream and yet so far from it.

One day, he went to the merchant and asked him if he could take a week off. The merchant agreed, and the boy set off to fulfill his dream.

He walked for many days, following the instructions of the gypsy woman. He slept in fields and in abandoned churches. He met other travelers, and he learned from them. He sold a few of his sheep to buy food and to pay for the journey. He was tired and dirty, but he kept walking.

At last, he arrived in a small town in the mountains. It was a beautiful town, with narrow streets and white houses. The people were friendly, and he felt at home there.

He went to the marketplace and began looking for a job. He found work in a bakery, and he slept in the bakery at night. The baker was a kind man, and he taught the boy many things about bread and baking. The boy worked hard, and he was happy. He felt that he was fulfilling his Personal Legend, and he was content.

One day, he was sitting in the plaza, watching the people go by. He noticed a man who was dressed in black, with a falcon on his shoulder. The man was watching the people too, and the boy was curious. He went up to the man and asked him about his falcon.

The man was a wise man, and he had traveled all over the world. He told the boy about the desert and the pyramids. He told him that there was a treasure at the pyramids, and that he could help him find it.

The boy was excited, and he agreed to go with the man. They traveled for many days, and the boy learned much from the man. He learned about the stars and about the desert. He learned about the wind and about the sand.

At last, they arrived at the pyramids. The man gave the boy a piece of paper with a map on it. He told him to follow the map and to dig at a certain place.

The boy was excited, and he set off to find the treasure. He dug and dug, but he found nothing. He became discouraged, and he began to cry. He felt that he had wasted his life searching for something that did not exist.

But then he remembered the words of the old king. He remembered that the journey was more important than the treasure. He remembered that he had learned many things along the way, and that he had fulfilled his Personal Legend.

He stood up and looked at the desert. He was tired and dirty, but he was happy. He knew that he had found what he was looking for.
