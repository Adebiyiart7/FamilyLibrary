Chapter 7

As the boy continued his journey, he came across a crystal merchant who was sitting outside his shop. The merchant was an old man with a wrinkled face and a sad expression. He had been in the same spot for many years, selling crystals to travelers who passed through the desert.

The boy approached the merchant and asked him if he could work for him. He explained that he was trying to earn some money to continue his journey, and that he was willing to work hard.

The merchant looked at the boy for a moment, and then he nodded his head. "Very well," he said. "You can help me with my business."

The boy was thrilled. He had never worked before, but he was eager to learn. He began to help the merchant clean his crystals and organize his shop. He worked hard every day, and he did his best to learn everything he could about the crystal business.

But after a few weeks, the boy began to realize that the crystal merchant was not happy. He was sad and disillusioned, and he had lost his passion for the crystal business. The boy asked him about this, and the merchant explained that he had once had dreams of traveling the world and selling his crystals to people from all over.

"But I never did it," the merchant said. "I let my fear and my doubts stop me from following my dreams. And now I am old, and I have spent my entire life in this one spot. I have never seen the world, and I have never accomplished anything of significance."

The boy listened to the merchant's story, and he felt sorry for him. But he also knew that he did not want to end up like the merchant, living a life filled with regret and missed opportunities.

He realized that he had to follow his own dreams, no matter how difficult or impossible they might seem. He knew that he had to be brave and take risks if he wanted to find his treasure.

And so, the boy made a decision. He would leave the crystal merchant's shop and continue on his journey. He knew that it would not be easy, but he was determined to see it through to the end.

The merchant wished him well, and he gave him some advice. "Remember," he said, "when you really want something, the whole universe conspires in helping you to achieve it."

The boy thanked the merchant for his kindness and his advice, and he set out once again into the desert. He knew that his journey would be difficult, but he was filled with hope and determination. He knew that he was getting closer to his Personal Legend, and he was determined to follow his dreams, no matter what challenges he might face.
